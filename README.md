# DungeonRPG
This document proposes a Discord bot called Dungeon RPG that enables users to play different dungeons and have fun on the Discord platform. Any Discord server can easily add the bot because it is integrated with the Discord API. Users of Dungeon RPG can access dungeons according to their Hunter rank. For instance, Hunters of the D rank can access D rank dungeons, Hunters of the C rank can access C rank dungeons, and possibly B rank dungeons, etc. The dungeon is basically a turn-based game that could possibly utilize randomness/luck. Anyone may start playing straight away thanks to the bot's intuitive user interface. By successfully clearing dungeons, players can level up and gain access to new Hunter ranks. Users can greatly improve their Discord experience and meet new people by playing Dungeon RPG.
